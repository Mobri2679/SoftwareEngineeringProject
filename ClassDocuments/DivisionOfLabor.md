# Division of Labor
#### DISCLAIMER (We all worked on the documentation equally. Davis commited all of them because he made the repo originally. Please take that into account when looking at commit history.)
#### DISCLAIMER PT.2 (Anthony accidentally pushed a private key for almost all of his commits so they were scrubbed. He had more commits.)

### Davis: 
- Worked on making everyone's part work together. 
- Helped each member with how to implement their parts because he is the most familliar with Python and because he has the most experience with programming projects. 
- Led the group's choices with certain implementation strategies.

### Anthony:
- Worked on getting the API connection working. 
- Found the API that we are using. 

### Craig:
- Made the interface that we are using.
  - Explained how it worked to Davis.
- Provided helpful insight on how to combine parts.

### Mostafa:
- Made class implementations for the users.
  - Will be used later on, not in use yet.

### Ryan:
- Created the database connection.
- Informed Davis how Mongo worked, allowing for easier implementaion.
